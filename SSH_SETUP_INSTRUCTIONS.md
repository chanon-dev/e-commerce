## ✅ SSH Key Generated Successfully

### 📋 Your Public SSH Key:
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOisb/R5asVrRSrf0ZT9dc+J0t/ixanzvdZkPUZUvhrF admin@ecommerce.local
```

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### 1. Add SSH Key to GitHub
1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click your profile picture → **Settings**
3. In the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**
4. Click **New SSH key**
5. Add a title: `E-Commerce Platform`
6. Paste the public key above into the **Key** field
7. Click **Add SSH key**

### 2. Test SSH Connection
After adding the key to GitHub, run:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see:
```
Hi chanon-dev! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### 3. Push Code to Repository
Once SSH is working:
```bash
cd /Workshop/ecommerce
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:chanon-dev/e-commerce.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔧 SSH Key Details
- **Type**: ED25519 (most secure)
- **Location**: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- **Public Key**: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- **Email**: `admin@ecommerce.local`

## 🛡️ Security Notes
- Keep your private key (`id_ed25519`) secure
- Never share your private key
- The public key (shown above) is safe to share
- SSH agent is running and key is loaded

## 📝 Alternative: Use HTTPS with Token
If you prefer HTTPS instead of SSH:
```bash
# Use personal access token instead
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/chanon-dev/e-commerce.git
git push -u origin main
# GitHub will prompt for username and token
```
